{"problem_name": "a_plus_zero", "informal_statement": "\u2200 (a : \u2115), a + 0 = a", "informal_proof": "We will prove this theorem by induction on `a`.\n\nBase case: Let `a = 0`. We need to show that `0 + 0 = 0`. This is true by the definition of addition.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement holds for some `a = k`, where `k` is a natural number. That is, assume `k + 0 = k`. We need to show that `(k + 1) + 0 = k + 1`.\n\nBy the definition of addition, `(k + 1) + 0` is the successor of `k + 0`. By the inductive hypothesis, `k + 0 = k`. Therefore, the successor of `k + 0` is just the successor of `k`, which is `k + 1`. Hence, `(k + 1) + 0 = k + 1`.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers `a`.\n\nThis completes the proof."}
