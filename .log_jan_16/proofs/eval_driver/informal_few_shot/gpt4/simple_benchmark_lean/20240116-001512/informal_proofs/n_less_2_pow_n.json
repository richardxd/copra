{"problem_name": "n_less_2_pow_n", "informal_statement": "n < 2 ^ n", "informal_proof": "To prove that $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$, we will use mathematical induction.\n\nBase case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement is true for $k + 1$, i.e., $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nStarting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get $2k < 2 \\cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nNow, since $k$ is a natural number, $k \\geq 1$, which implies that $k + 1 \\leq 2k$. Therefore, $k + 1 \\leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nThus, we have shown that if the statement is true for $k$, it is also true for $k + 1$.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ is true for all natural numbers $n$."}
