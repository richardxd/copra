{"problem_name": "mod_arith_1", "informal_statement": "x % 2 = 0 \u2192 x * x % 2 = 0", "informal_proof": "We will prove this statement using the definition of divisibility and properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nLet $x$ be an integer such that $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This means that $x$ is even, and there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.\n\nNow, consider $x^2$. We have:\n$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$\n\nLet $m = 2k^2$. Then $x^2 = 2m$, which means $x^2$ is also even. Therefore, $x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nThus, if $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, then $x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which completes the proof."}
