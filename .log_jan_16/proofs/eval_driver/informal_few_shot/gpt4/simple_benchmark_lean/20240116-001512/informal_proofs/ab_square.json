{"problem_name": "ab_square", "informal_statement": "\u2200 (a b : \u211d), (a + b) ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + 2 * a * b", "informal_proof": "We will prove the theorem by expanding the left-hand side and simplifying it to match the right-hand side.\n\nLet $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary real numbers. We want to show that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$.\n\nStarting with the left-hand side:\n$(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)$\n$= a(a + b) + b(a + b)$ (by distributive property)\n$= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$ (again by distributive property)\n$= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$ (since $ba = ab$ by commutativity of multiplication)\n$= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ (by combining like terms).\n\nThus, we have shown that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.\n\nThis completes the proof."}
