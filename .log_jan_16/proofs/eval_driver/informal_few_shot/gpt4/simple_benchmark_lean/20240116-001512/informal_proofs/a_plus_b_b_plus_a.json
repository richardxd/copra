{"problem_name": "a_plus_b_b_plus_a", "informal_statement": "a + b = b + a", "informal_proof": "To prove that addition is commutative for all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, that is, $a + b = b + a$, we will use the axioms of Peano arithmetic and the definition of addition.\n\nThe proof is by induction on $b$.\n\nBase case: Let $b = 0$. We need to show that $a + 0 = 0 + a$.\nBy the definition of addition, $a + 0 = a$. \nBy the definition of zero as the additive identity, $0 + a = a$.\nTherefore, $a + 0 = 0 + a$.\n\nInductive step: Assume that for a particular $b$, we have $a + b = b + a$. We need to show that $a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a$.\nBy the definition of addition, $a + (b + 1) = (a + b) + 1$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis, $a + b = b + a$.\nSubstituting this into our equation, we get $(a + b) + 1 = (b + a) + 1$.\nBy the definition of addition, $(b + a) + 1 = b + (a + 1)$.\nBy the definition of addition, $b + (a + 1) = (b + 1) + a$.\nTherefore, $a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a$.\n\nBy induction, we have shown that for all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, $a + b = b + a$."}
