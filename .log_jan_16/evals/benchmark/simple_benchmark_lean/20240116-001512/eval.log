[PROOF]
To prove that addition is commutative for all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, that is, $a + b = b + a$, we will use the axioms of Peano arithmetic and the definition of addition.

The proof is by induction on $b$.

Base case: Let $b = 0$. We need to show that $a + 0 = 0 + a$.
By the definition of addition, $a + 0 = a$. 
By the definition of zero as the additive identity, $0 + a = a$.
Therefore, $a + 0 = 0 + a$.

Inductive step: Assume that for a particular $b$, we have $a + b = b + a$. We need to show that $a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a$.
By the definition of addition, $a + (b + 1) = (a + b) + 1$.
By the inductive hypothesis, $a + b = b + a$.
Substituting this into our equation, we get $(a + b) + 1 = (b + a) + 1$.
By the definition of addition, $(b + a) + 1 = b + (a + 1)$.
By the definition of addition, $b + (a + 1) = (b + 1) + a$.
Therefore, $a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a$.

By induction, we have shown that for all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, $a + b = b + a$.

[PROOF]
We will prove this theorem by induction on `a`.

Base case: Let `a = 0`. We need to show that `0 + 0 = 0`. This is true by the definition of addition.

Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for some `a = k`, where `k` is a natural number. That is, assume `k + 0 = k`. We need to show that `(k + 1) + 0 = k + 1`.

By the definition of addition, `(k + 1) + 0` is the successor of `k + 0`. By the inductive hypothesis, `k + 0 = k`. Therefore, the successor of `k + 0` is just the successor of `k`, which is `k + 1`. Hence, `(k + 1) + 0 = k + 1`.

Since both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers `a`.

This completes the proof.

[PROOF]
We will prove the theorem by expanding the left-hand side and simplifying it to match the right-hand side.

Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary real numbers. We want to show that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$.

Starting with the left-hand side:
$(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)$
$= a(a + b) + b(a + b)$ (by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$ (again by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$ (since $ba = ab$ by commutativity of multiplication)
$= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ (by combining like terms).

Thus, we have shown that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.

This completes the proof.

[PROOF]
We will prove this statement using the definition of divisibility and properties of modular arithmetic.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$. This means that $x$ is even, and there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Then $x^2 = 2m$, which means $x^2$ is also even. Therefore, $x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$.

Thus, if $x \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$, then $x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$, which completes the proof.

[PROOF]
To prove that $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$, we will use mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement is true for $k + 1$, i.e., $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$.

Now, since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, which implies that $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Therefore, $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Thus, we have shown that if the statement is true for $k$, it is also true for $k + 1$.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ is true for all natural numbers $n$.
