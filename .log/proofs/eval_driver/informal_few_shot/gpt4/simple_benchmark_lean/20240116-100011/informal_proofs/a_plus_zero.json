{"problem_name": "a_plus_zero", "informal_statement": "\u2200 (a : \u2115), a + 0 = a", "informal_proof": "We will prove this theorem by induction on `a`.\n\nBase case: Let `a = 0`. We need to show that `0 + 0 = 0`. This is true by the definition of addition.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement holds for some `a`, i.e., `a + 0 = a`. We need to show that `(a + 1) + 0 = a + 1`.\n\nBy the definition of addition, `(a + 1) + 0` is the successor of `a + 0`, which by the inductive hypothesis is `a`. Therefore, `(a + 1) + 0` is the successor of `a`, which is `a + 1`.\n\nThus, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers `a`."}
