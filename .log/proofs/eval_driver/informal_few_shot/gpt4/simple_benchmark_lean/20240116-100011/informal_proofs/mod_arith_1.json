{"problem_name": "mod_arith_1", "informal_statement": "x % 2 = 0 \u2192 x * x % 2 = 0", "informal_proof": "We will prove this by direct proof.\n\nLet $x$ be an integer such that $x \\mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.\n\nNow, consider $x^2$. We have:\n$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$\n\nLet $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.\n\nSince $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \\mod 2 = 0$.\n\nThus, if $x \\mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \\mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof."}
