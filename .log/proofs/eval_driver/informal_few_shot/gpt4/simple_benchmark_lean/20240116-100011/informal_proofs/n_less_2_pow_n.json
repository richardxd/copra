{"problem_name": "n_less_2_pow_n", "informal_statement": "n < 2 ^ n", "informal_proof": "We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.\n\nBase case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nStarting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \\cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \\geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \\leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \\leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nTherefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$."}
