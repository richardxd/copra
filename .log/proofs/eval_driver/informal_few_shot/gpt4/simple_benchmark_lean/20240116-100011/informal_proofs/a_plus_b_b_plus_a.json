{"problem_name": "a_plus_b_b_plus_a", "informal_statement": "a + b = b + a", "informal_proof": "The theorem states that addition is commutative for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This is a fundamental property of addition in the context of natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The proof for each of these domains is based on the axiomatic system that defines the arithmetic operations within that domain.\n\nFor the sake of this proof, let's consider \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to be natural numbers. The commutativity of addition for natural numbers is typically taken as an axiom in the standard construction of arithmetic. However, if we are working within the Peano axioms, which are a common foundation for the natural numbers, the commutativity can be proven using induction.\n\nHere is a sketch of the proof using the Peano axioms:\n\n1. Prove that for any natural number \\(a\\), \\(a + 0 = 0 + a = a\\). This is the base case and is true by the definition of addition.\n2. Assume for induction that for a fixed natural number \\(b\\), \\(a + b = b + a\\) holds for all natural numbers \\(a\\).\n3. We need to show that \\(a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a\\).\n4. By the definition of addition (using the successor function \\(S\\)), we have \\(a + (b + 1) = a + S(b) = S(a + b)\\).\n5. By the inductive hypothesis, \\(a + b = b + a\\), so \\(S(a + b) = S(b + a)\\).\n6. Again, by the definition of addition, \\(S(b + a) = (b + 1) + a\\).\n7. Therefore, \\(a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a\\), which completes the inductive step.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that addition is commutative for all natural numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This completes the proof."}
