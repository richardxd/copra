[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
a + b = b + a

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
The theorem states that addition is commutative for any two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This is a fundamental property of addition in the context of natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The proof for each of these domains is based on the axiomatic system that defines the arithmetic operations within that domain.

For the sake of this proof, let's consider \(a\) and \(b\) to be natural numbers. The commutativity of addition for natural numbers is typically taken as an axiom in the standard construction of arithmetic. However, if we are working within the Peano axioms, which are a common foundation for the natural numbers, the commutativity can be proven using induction.

Here is a sketch of the proof using the Peano axioms:

1. Prove that for any natural number \(a\), \(a + 0 = 0 + a = a\). This is the base case and is true by the definition of addition.
2. Assume for induction that for a fixed natural number \(b\), \(a + b = b + a\) holds for all natural numbers \(a\).
3. We need to show that \(a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a\).
4. By the definition of addition (using the successor function \(S\)), we have \(a + (b + 1) = a + S(b) = S(a + b)\).
5. By the inductive hypothesis, \(a + b = b + a\), so \(S(a + b) = S(b + a)\).
6. Again, by the definition of addition, \(S(b + a) = (b + 1) + a\).
7. Therefore, \(a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a\), which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that addition is commutative for all natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This completes the proof.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

∀ (a : ℕ), a + 0 = a

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
∀ (a : ℕ), a + 0 = a

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this theorem by induction on `a`.

Base case: Let `a = 0`. We need to show that `0 + 0 = 0`. This is true by the definition of addition.

Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for some `a`, i.e., `a + 0 = a`. We need to show that `(a + 1) + 0 = a + 1`.

By the definition of addition, `(a + 1) + 0` is the successor of `a + 0`, which by the inductive hypothesis is `a`. Therefore, `(a + 1) + 0` is the successor of `a`, which is `a + 1`.

Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers `a`.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

∀ (a : ℕ), a + 0 = a

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
∀ (a : ℕ), a + 0 = a

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this theorem by induction on `a`.

Base case: Let `a = 0`. We need to show that `0 + 0 = 0`. This is true by the definition of addition.

Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for some `a`, i.e., `a + 0 = a`. We need to show that `(a + 1) + 0 = a + 1`.

By the definition of addition, `(a + 1) + 0` is the successor of `a + 0`, which by the inductive hypothesis is `a`. Therefore, `(a + 1) + 0` is the successor of `a`, which is `a + 1`.

Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers `a`.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem by expanding the left-hand side and simplifying it to match the right-hand side.

Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary real numbers. We want to show that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$.

Starting with the left-hand side:
$(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)$
$= a(a + b) + b(a + b)$ (by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$ (again by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$ (since $ba = ab$ by commutativity of multiplication)
$= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ (by combining like terms).

Thus, we have shown that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation we wanted to prove.

Since $a$ and $b$ were arbitrary real numbers, this completes the proof.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem by expanding the left-hand side and simplifying it to match the right-hand side.

Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary real numbers. We want to show that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$.

Starting with the left-hand side:
$(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)$
$= a(a + b) + b(a + b)$ (by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$ (again by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$ (since $ba = ab$ by commutativity of multiplication)
$= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ (by combining like terms).

Thus, we have shown that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation we wanted to prove.

Since $a$ and $b$ were arbitrary real numbers, this completes the proof.

Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[HYPOTHESES] 1
[HYPOTHESIS] x : ℕ

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[HYPOTHESIS] h : x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great!

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[HYPOTHESIS] x : ℕ
[HYPOTHESIS] h : x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7.

We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[HYPOTHESIS] x : ℕ

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
x % 2 = 0 → x * x % 2 = 0

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
n < 2 ^ n

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great!

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great!

Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great! The proof is complete.', \\nStopping Reason: 'stop'.\\n Please respond only in the format specified.[END]`. This means that the response generated by you was not in the specified format. Please follow the specified format strictly.\n\nIf you think you know the next proof step, then start your response with `[RUN TACTIC]` followed by the next proof-step which will help in simplifying the current proof state. For example, `[RUN TACTIC]induction c,[END]`. Generate exactly ONE proof-step. Multiple proof steps are more error prone, because you will not get a chance to see intermediate proof state descriptions. Make sure that the proof step is valid and compiles correctly in Lean 3.\n\nYou can refer to the example conversation to understand the response format better. It might also contain some similar proof states and their corresponding proof-steps.\n\n Please take a note of the following: \n 1. Make sure to end all your responses with the keyword `[END]`. Follow the specified format strictly. \n 2. While generating `[RUN TACTIC]` keyword, do NOT generate the tactics mentioned under `[INCORRECT STEPS]` in the proof state description because they are failed tactics which have been tried earlier. Similary do NOT generate the last tactic if it was NOT successful. Re-generating proof-steps which mentioned in `[INCORRECT STEPS]` or failed `[LAST STEPS]` will lead to backtracking and early termination of proof search. \n 3. Do NOT finish the proof in one shot ending with `end`. Always go step by step. Ideally individual tactics are NOT long, so don't generate too many tokens, unless necessary. Generating single step allows the user to give more proof state after each step, which will help you in writing correct proof-steps."}, {'role': 'system', 'name': 'example_user', 'content': 'Goals to prove:\n[GOALS]\n[GOAL] 1\nx = 1 ∧ y = 1\n[HYPOTHESES] 1\n[HYPOTHESIS] x y : ℝ\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₁: x = 3 - 2 * y\n[HYPOTHESIS] h₂: 2 * x - y = 1\n\n[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\nAt which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect?

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
n < 2 ^ n

[INFORMAL-PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a proficient formal theorem-proving agent in Lean 3. You can predict the next proof step given the current proof state. The proof state is described in the following format:\n1. All the goals are described under `[GOALS]` keyword. Each goal within the `[GOALS]` is described under the keyword `[GOAL] i`, where `i` is a positive integer. For example, `[GOAL] 1`, `[GOAL] 2`, etc.\n2. Within each `[GOAL] i` keyword, the goal is described as a human-readable serialized version of the proof state as shown while running `lean` command. Each goal, might also accompany some hypotheses, which are described under the keyword `[HYPOTHESES] i`. Each hypothesis within `[HYPOTHESES]`, starts with the prefix `[HYPOTHESIS]`. Apart from the goal and hypothesis, some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS] i` and `[THEOREMS] i` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in that goal, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each theorem/lemma within `[THEOREMS]` starts with the prefix `[THEOREM]`.\n3. Optional keywords like `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]` and `[INFORMAL-PROOFS]` which will describe the proofs and theorems in natural language. The proof is described in for the whole theorem along with the theorem statement rather than just the proof state. For example, `[INFORMAL-THEOREM]\\nThe sum of two even numbers is even.\\n[INFORMAL-PROOFS]\\nSuppose a and b are even numbers. Then there exist integers m and n such that a = 2 * m and b = 2 * n. Then a + b = 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * (m + n). Since m + n is an integer, a + b is even.`. The whole proof is described in natural language, and the proof state is not described. The proof state is described in the `[GOALS]` keyword which should be used to generate the next proof step.\n4. Finally, `[STEPS]` keyword is used to describe proof-steps used so far. Each proof step starts with the prefix `[STEP]`, and is a valid Lean tactic. For example, `[STEPS][STEP]rw h₁ at h₂,[STEP]{linarith},`.\n5. Sometimes, `[INCORRECT STEPS]` keyword optionally used to describe proof-steps which should NOT be generated. Use this as a hint for not generating these proof-steps again as they failed previously. For example, `[INCORRECT STEPS][STEP]apply h₁,[STEP]rw ←h₁`. **DO NOT** generate these `[INCORRECT STEPS]` again.\n6. There is also an optional `[LAST STEP]` keyword which describes the proof-step generated last time. If the proof-step was incorrect, then it is also followed by error message from Coq environment. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,\\n[ERROR MESSAGE]linarith failed to find a contradiction\\nstate:\\nx y : ℝ,\\nh₁ : x = 3 - 2 * y,\\nh₂ : 2 * x - y = 1\\n⊢ false`. If the proof-step was correct then it is followed by the keyword `[SUCCESS]`. For example, `[LAST STEP]linarith,[SUCCESS]`. Don't generate the last proof-step again if it was NOT successful.\n7. Sometimes there can be errors in the format of the generated response. This is reported using the keyword `[ERROR]` followed by the error message. For example, `[ERROR]\\nInvalid response:\\n'Great!

We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nStarting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \\cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \\geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \\leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \\leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.\n\nTherefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.\n[THEOREMS] 1\n[THEOREM] nat.fib_lt_fib_succ : {n : ℕ} (hn : 2 ≤ n) : fib n < fib (n + 1)\n[THEOREM] nat.digits_aux_def : (b : ℕ) (h : 2 ≤ b) (n : ℕ) (w : 0 < n) :   digits_aux b h n = n % b :: digits_aux b h (n/b)\n[THEOREM] nat.eq_of_le_of_lt_succ : {n m : ℕ} (h₁ : n ≤ m) (h₂ : m < n + 1) : m = n\n\n[INCORRECT STEPS]\n[STEP] induction n with k hk,\n[END]'}]
