[PROOF]
The theorem states that addition is commutative for any two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This is a fundamental property of addition in the context of natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The proof for each of these domains is based on the axiomatic system that defines the arithmetic operations within that domain.

For the sake of this proof, let's consider \(a\) and \(b\) to be natural numbers. The commutativity of addition for natural numbers is typically taken as an axiom in the standard construction of arithmetic. However, if we are working within the Peano axioms, which are a common foundation for the natural numbers, the commutativity can be proven using induction.

Here is a sketch of the proof using the Peano axioms:

1. Prove that for any natural number \(a\), \(a + 0 = 0 + a = a\). This is the base case and is true by the definition of addition.
2. Assume for induction that for a fixed natural number \(b\), \(a + b = b + a\) holds for all natural numbers \(a\).
3. We need to show that \(a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a\).
4. By the definition of addition (using the successor function \(S\)), we have \(a + (b + 1) = a + S(b) = S(a + b)\).
5. By the inductive hypothesis, \(a + b = b + a\), so \(S(a + b) = S(b + a)\).
6. Again, by the definition of addition, \(S(b + a) = (b + 1) + a\).
7. Therefore, \(a + (b + 1) = (b + 1) + a\), which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that addition is commutative for all natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This completes the proof.

We will prove the theorem by expanding the left-hand side and simplifying it to match the right-hand side.

Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary real numbers. We want to show that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$.

Starting with the left-hand side:
$(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)$
$= a(a + b) + b(a + b)$ (by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$ (again by distributive property)
$= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$ (since $ba = ab$ by commutativity of multiplication)
$= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ (by combining like terms).

Thus, we have shown that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation we wanted to prove.

Since $a$ and $b$ were arbitrary real numbers, this completes the proof.

[PROOF]
We will prove this by direct proof.

Let $x$ be an integer such that $x \mod 2 = 0$. This means that $x$ is even, and by definition of even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k$.

Now, consider $x^2$. We have:
$$x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$$

Let $m = 2k^2$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x^2 = 2m$, which means that $x^2$ is even.

Since $x^2$ is even, it follows that $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$.

Thus, if $x \mod 2 = 0$, then $x^2 \mod 2 = 0$. This completes the proof.

[PROOF]
We will prove the theorem $n < 2^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ using mathematical induction.

Base case: Let $n = 1$. We have $1 < 2^1 = 2$, which is true. Thus, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some natural number $k$, i.e., $k < 2^k$. We need to show that the statement holds for $k + 1$, that is, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$.

Starting from the inductive hypothesis $k < 2^k$, we can multiply both sides by 2 to obtain $2k < 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$. Since $k$ is a natural number, $k \geq 1$, and thus $k + 1 \leq 2k$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $k + 1 \leq 2k < 2^{k + 1}$.

Therefore, $k + 1 < 2^{k + 1}$, which completes the inductive step.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $n < 2^n$ holds for all natural numbers $n$.
